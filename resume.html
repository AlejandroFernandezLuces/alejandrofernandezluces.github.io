<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>Research &amp; Development Engineer at Ansys, where I’m developing PyAnsys open source initiative. I loved the machine learning and computer vision subjects during my bachelor’s degree, so I decided to specialize on it with a master’s degree. Passionate about all sciences.</p>
<h1 id="skills-overview">Skills overview</h1>
<h2 id="software-engineering">Software engineering</h2>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>I mostly program in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> (3 years work experience), and some <strong>Golang</strong>. I’m experienced in <strong>object oriented programming</strong>, so I’m comfortable in any language that uses this paradigm. I’ve implemented plenty of <strong>REST</strong> services, using <strong>OpenAPI</strong> for the specification, <strong>Flask</strong> framework in Python, and <strong>Boost</strong> in C++.</li>
<li>I’ve continuously been using <strong>Git</strong> since the start of my career, with Github and Gitlab, to organize and maintain my code, and to properly collaborate with others. I’ve implemented <strong>Github Workflows</strong> for the continous integration and continuous delivery of my projects, as well as some open source <strong>Github Actions</strong>. Also, I’ve worked plenty with <strong>Docker</strong> to containerize my applications for easier deployment.</li>
<li>To sustain code quality in the projects I participate in, I use extensive code testing, through <strong>PyTest</strong> and <strong>Google test</strong> frameworks. Also I participate in <strong>code reviews</strong> to ensure code quality, both as reviewer and reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="machine-learning-and-computer-vision">Machine Learning and computer vision</h2>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>I’m working on several language processing projects, where I use <strong>OpenAI Azure</strong>, <strong>Ollama</strong> and <strong>HuggingFace</strong>, for RAG based applications for coding helpers.</li>
<li>I’ve worked with <strong>OpenCV</strong> and different <strong>deep learning</strong> approaches for <strong>real time object detection and classification</strong>.</li>
